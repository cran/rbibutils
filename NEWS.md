# rbibutils 1.4 (CRAN)

  `type`.  (reported by Kisung You for `Rdpack`, issue #17)

- fixed a compiler warning about a pointer differing in
  signedness from the expected type (reported by Patrice Kiener).

- somehow `README.md` went missing in v1.3, now reinstated.


# rbibutils 1.3 (CRAN)

- reverted a change in v1.2 which caused trouble with some latex characters.

- trimmed white space in cite keys and some others to avoid getting cite keys
  containing the newline character (possible if the comma after the key is on a

  `if` clauses in `src/adsout.c` and default argument promotion of the second
  argument in a couple of invocations of `va_start` in `src/modsout.c`).

- fixed typo's in the documentation.

- updated the website.
